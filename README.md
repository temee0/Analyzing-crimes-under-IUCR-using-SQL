![](https://github.com/temee0/Analyzing-crimes-under-IUCR-using-SQL/blob/main/front_page.jpg)

## Introduction
This report delves into a meticulous examination of crimes cataloged under the Illinois Uniform "Crime Reporting (IUCR) system, spanning from 2001 to the present day. The IUCR, a standardized method for classifying criminal offenses, offers a comprehensive framework for organizing and interpreting diverse criminal activities, providing invaluable insights into the evolving nature of crime over the years. Within this report, there are subsections derived from the main data that focus on child-related crimes, sex crimes, and homicide.
The Structured query language(SQL) was used to understand the crime dynamics, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and targeted interventions.
This project serves as a dynamic platform to elevate my SQL skills, allowing me to navigate the complexities of data analytics.
